## Project infos

Cookie Clicker is an incremental game created by French programmer Julien "Orteil" Thiennot in 2013. The user initially clicks on a big cookie on the screen, earning a single cookie per click. They can then spend their earned cookies upon purchasing assets such as "cursors" and other "buildings" that automatically produce cookies. Upgrades are also available and can improve the efficiency of clicks and buildings, among many other mechanics that allow the user to earn cookies in different ways.

## Goal

- Discovering the react.js environment and implementing a replica of the "cookie clicker" game through the use of its library.

## What did I learn?
- React.js basics
- Parcel bundler
- Tailwind CSS in React projects
- How to install dependencies and run parcel's server using `npm`

## Final Result

Still to come, but will be available soon at https://aurorevanhoorebeke.github.io/Cookie-clicker/
